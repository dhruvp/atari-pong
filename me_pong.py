## Architecture

# Take in inputs from the screen and preprocess them
# Pass them into an NN
# Update the weights of the NN using gradient descent
# weights['1'] - Matrix that holds weights of pixels passing into hidden layer. Dimensions: [200 x 80 x 80] -> [200 x 6400]
# weights['2'] - Matrix that holds weights of hidden layer passing into output. Dimensions: [1 x 200]

# Process is:

# processed_observations = image vector - [6400 x 1] array
# Compute hidden_layer_values = weights['1'] dot processed_observations ([200 x 6400] dot [6400 x 1]) -> [200 x 1] - this gives initial activation values.
# Next we need to transform those either via a sigmoid or an ReLU of some sort. Let's use ReLU
# ReLU(hidden_layer_values)
# Next we need to pass this one layer further
# output_layer_value = weights['2'] dot hidden_layer_values ([1 x 200] dot [200 x 1] -> [1 x 1])
# Now our output layer is the probability of going up or down. Let's make sure this output is between 0 and 1 by passing it through a sigmoid
# p = sigmoid(output_layer_value)

# Learning after round has finished:

# Figure out the result
# Compute the error
# Use the error to calculate the gradient
    # The below dimensions all assume we had exactly 10 frames in the round (not necessarily true!)
    # dC_dw2 = hidden_layer_values^T dot gradient_log_p ([1 x 2000] dot [2000 x 1] -> 1x1)
    # delta_1 = gradient_log_p outer_product weights['2'] = [2000 x 1] outer_product [1 x 200] ([2000 x 200])
    # dC_dw1 = delta_1^T dot input_observations ([200 x 2000]x dot [2000 x 64000] -> [200 x 64000])

# After some batch size of rounds has finished,
    # Use rmsprop to move weights['1'] and weights['2'] in the direction of the gradient
# Repeat!
